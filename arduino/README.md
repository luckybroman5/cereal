## Arduino Overview

###### In order to provide all that's needed, I'm overproviding details, so hopefully all you'll need is this repo.

### Directory Layout
- `lib/` - contains all libraries needed if you need to compile your own Arduino Build
- `src/` - contains the .ino or raw sketch files
- `build/` - Precompiled builds for specific devices

### Dependencies

###### Just in case you need another version than what's in lib/
